# wp-childtheme-benmiles
Ben Miles Portfolio is a WordPress childtheme of GK Portfolio. I created it for my personal use on http://www.ben-miles.com. GK Portfolio is an exceptional and free portfolio theme, but there were some features and style changes I wanted to add.

Ben Miles Portfolio requires WordPress ( http://wordpress.org/ ) and the GK Portfolio theme ( https://wordpress.org/themes/gk-portfolio/ ).

Features:
* Frontpage/archive templates modified to use custom fields for extended project meta data. 
* Header images randomly selected from a directory on load by PHP, and animated with CSS3.
* Footer social menu uses FontAwesome and jQuery with custom animation.
* Numerous minor layout changes.
